# Swizzle
An extensible tweak to create simple tweaks for any app, from within any app.

### System-wide tweak functionality is not yet implemetned.

## For users

Trigger the FLEXing window. Click on the `TWEAK` button to present the Swizzle window. There are two tabs: local, and system. Local tweaks apply to the current app ONLY, and system tweaks apply to any app where the target class is found, including SpringBoard.

A "tweak" is comprised of one or more "hooks." Tap the + button to create a tweak. Swizzle will ask for a name. Tweaks can be toggled on or off. Select a tweak to give it some hooks. You can swipe to delete hooks. 

Tap the + button to add some hooks. This will present a new screen with a list of open bundles. Once you select a bundle, you must select a class, then a method. Once you have a method selected, you can configure and save the hook.

Bundles are things like the app binary itself, UIKit, MapKit, etc. Bundles hold different classes. Selecting a bundle reveals all classes it holds. Selecting a class reveals all methods it implements and inherits. Selecting an inherited method will **add** an implementation in the selected class.

You can type to filter any of the lists mentioned above, using the format `bundle.class.[-+]method`, where `bundle` is a bundle name, `class` is a class name, and `[-+]method` is a method name, such as `-count` or `+imageNamed:`. You can filter the lists with wildcards. Some examples:

- `UI*` would reveal all bundles whose names start with `UI`.
- `Snapchat.*` would reveal all classes in the Snapchat binary if you were in the Snapchat app.
- `Snapchat.*.-` would reveal all instance methods of every class in the Snapchat app binary.
- `Snapchat.*.*` would reveal *all* methods of every class in the Snapchat app binary (as would simply `Snapchat.*.`). 
- `*Kit\.framework.*view` would reveal all classes containing the word `view` in bundles whose names end with `Kit.framework`, such as `UIKit\.framework` or `MapKit\.framework`.
- `*.*.` and `*.*.*` reveal every single method in the current runtime. This level of detail might take a while to gather...

The `\.` escape is needed in some bundle names to prevent interpreting `MapKit\.framework` as `bundle=MapKit, class=framework`.

### Developers:

Installing Swizzle as a tweak is straightforward if you already have the Xcode project building. Just do `make package install` like usual.

The Xcode project has a podfile that relies on MirrorKit. In the podfile, change `pod 'MirrorKit', :path => '../../../MirrorKit'` to `pod 'MirrorKit', :git => 'https://github.com/NSExceptional/MirrorKit.git', :branch => '2.0'`, then run `pod install` from Terminal in the same directory as the podfile. The Xcode project builds an app that you can use to test Swizzle without being jailbroken or needing Theos to install.

# TODO

- [ ] System-wide tweak functionality.
- [ ] Online documentation (help wanted)
- [ ] Tweak preferences should be stored outside of app container (so that deleting an app does not delete your tweaks)
- [ ] Disallow deleting hooks from tweaks that are turned on
- [ ] Fix crashes and other performance issues in the "hook chooser" screen, specifically related to performing complex, large queries like `*.*view.*` or tapping on a result from a previous query before the current query finishes loading.
- [ ] Make value hooks more modular to allow third party extensions
